I would first like to thank my parents and my grandmother for offering wise counsel, a sympathetic ear and endless support.

I would also like to thank my tutors, Rafael Hostettler and Alona Kharchenko, for their valuable guidance throughout my studies. In addition, I would also like to thank the staff behind Roboy  for being part of this incredible project and for allowing me the possibility to write my thesis about this exciting topic.
